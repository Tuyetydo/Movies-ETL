# Movies-ETL

## Overview of Project
I am to perform the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database by refactoring the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files - Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data

### Purpose
The purpose is to keep the dataset updated on a daily basis. I am to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and laods the data into existing tables.

- [x] Deliverable 1: Write an ETL function to read three data files
- [x] Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
- [x] Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle Data
- [x] Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
